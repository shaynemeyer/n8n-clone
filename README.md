# n8n Clone

This is a clone of n8n. This project was born of my own curiosity of how to recreate n8n.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
